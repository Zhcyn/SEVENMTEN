An app for tracking activities with a UI influenced by the GitHub contribution grid, and a way for me to learn SwiftUI. The current application is still under development, and the current stage is mainly to test the continuity of the main interface UI and the integrity of the logical operation. If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me
